City Connection Status Application will determine if two cities are connected. Two cities are considered connected
if thereâ€™s a series of roads that can be traveled from one city to another.


You can use Spring Boot to create Java Rest Service applications that can be started using
`java -jar`.

Our primary goals are:

* Load the City Connections from the city.txt. If the file is not present then you get Internal Server Error.
The loader implementation can be changed without impacting the service layer.
* Validate whether the connection exist between the cities(bi-directional).
* Returns Yes if the cites are connected or returns No.
* When from city  or to city parameter is not provided then service will return No.
* Apis are documented using Swagger.

Getting Started:

* New Cities can be added into city.txt file with comma separated. Ex:  Boston, New York
